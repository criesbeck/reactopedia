    This is a centralized resource for students learning
    React and the React ecosystem.
  </div>

  <div>
    Understanding React requires understanding a large ecosystem of
    technologies.
</div>  

<div>
  To understand and write React code, you need to be familiar
  with modern JavaScript, i.e.,
  <a href="#javascript">EcmaScript 2015</a> (also known as ES6) and later. 
</div>

<div>
  To create and run React apps, you need <a href="#node">NodeJS</a> (also
  known as just Node). This is a standalone system for
  running scripts, similar to Python, but based on JavaScript.
  Node is used to implement the React command line interfaces (CLI).
</div>

<div>
  A critical part of Node is <a href="#npm">npm</a> (the Node
  Package Manager). <strong>npm</strong> downloads libraries and
  run scripts to build applications and start web servers.
</div>

<div>
  Of course there is <a href="#react">React</a> itself. This
  is a library of code for writing interactive web applications
  in JavaScript.
</div>

<div>
  React programs get complicated fast. To debug them, use
  <a href="#chrome-debugger">the Google Chrome debugger</a>. 
  Because React code is combined and transformed in many ways
  to become a normal HTML page, you need to add
  the React extension to Chrome.
</div>

<div>
  Most React apps are <strong>single page web apps</strong>. There is
  one web page that acts like a multi-page application, with distinct
  URLs for each page. The standard
  JavaScript library for doing this is
  <a href="#react-router">ReactRouter</a>.
</div>

<div>
  React components should be as independent as possible, but
  most applications have common state, i.e., data, that needs
  to be shared between components. The most commonly used
  library to do that is 
  <a href="#redux">Redux</a>.

<div>
  This is a toolbox for the software product <strong>client</strong>:
  the person with a vision of a product, and 
  a team of developers to help build it.
</div>

<div>
  There are many resources for <strong>agile developers</strong>.
  They focus on how programmers can radically alter the way they
  code, to deliver value to clients faster.
</div>

<div>
  There are many resources for <strong>agile project managers</strong>.
  They focus on how project managers can help 
  manage risks and remove obstacles in an agile development
  project.
</div>

<div>
  This resource is for <strong>agile clients</strong>.
  It focuses on how to apply agile values and principles 
  to product design, from initial idea formation to 
  a testable product.
</div>

<div>
  The tools in this toolbox are ideas. Most of these ideas
  are simple practices that agile
  team have found useful the past 20 years for achieving the primary
  goal of agile: delivering value quickly and frequently.
</div>

<div>
  Also in the toolbox are some common activities that clients
  will engage in frequently with their developers. 
  These activities are where 
  you work with the developers to make your vision real...
  and realistic.
</div>

<div>
  Agile is not about using these tools and doing these
  activities. You could do all of these things and not be agile.
  You could do none of them and still be agile. Agile is 
  a mindset that constantly looks for ways in which more
  value can be sustainably delivered more frequently.
</div>

<div>
<em>
  Warning: Agile development is a contact sport.</em> Being 
  an agile client requires frequent, effective communication
  with developers, not about code or technology, but 
  about end user product value.
</div>

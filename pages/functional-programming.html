    Functional programming means putting as much code as possible
    in functions that are free of side effects and global state.
    Such functions are easier to test, debug, and change.

  <div>
    Functional components are one example of this in React. These are 
    idea for components 
    that just display data, and do not have any local state, e.g., 
    open versus closed.

  <div>
    Functional programming works best when you divide your code
    into focused single-task functions. Such functions are easy
    to name and reuse.

  <div>
    Loops over arrays in functional code is typically done with
    the array iteration methods, rather than <strong>while</strong>
    or <strong>for</strong> loops. These methods include
    <strong>map()</strong>, <strong>filter()</strong>,
    <strong>find()</strong>, <strong>some()</strong>,
    <strong>every()</strong>, <strong>reduce()</strong>, and others.

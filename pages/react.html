    React is a JavaScript framework for building dynamic web apps.
    Everything is defined in terms of components. A component is
    entered onto a page like an HTML element, e.g., <code>&lt;Product&gt;</code>,
    but underneath is JavaScript code that contains data and
    instructions how to convert that data into actual HTML.
  </div>

  <div>
    Understanding React requires understanding a large ecosystem of
    technologies.
</div>  

<div>
  First is modern JavaScript, more specifically 
  <a href="#javascript">EcmaScript 2015</a> and later. 
  EcmaScript 2015 is sometimes referred to as ES6. 
</div>

<div>
  Second is <a href="#node">NodeJS</a>, or just Node. This is
  a way to run JavaScript as a standalone system, like Python,
  rather than in the browser. Node is used  as a scripting
  language to implement the React command line interfaces (CLI).
</div>

<div>
  A critical part of Node is <a href="#npm">npm</a>, the Node
  Package Manager, that is used to download libraries and
  run scripts to build applications and start web servers.
</div>

<div>
  React programs get complicated fast. To debug them, use
  <a href="#chrome-debugger">the Google Chrome debugger</a>. 
  Because React code is combined and transformed in many ways
  to become a normal HTML page, you need to add
  the React extension to Chrome.
</div>

<div>
  React components should be as independent as possible. To 
  share data between components, you use a library called
  <a href="#redux">Redux</a>.
</div>

<div>
  Most modern web apps are <strong>single page web apps</strong>. That means
  that there are multiple user screens, but only one actual web page.
  JavaScript code makes it look like you are moving around different pages.
  The library that handles this is 
  <a href="#react-router">the React Router</a>.

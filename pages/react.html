    <strong>React</strong> is a JavaScript framework for building dynamic web apps.
    Everything is defined in terms of HTML-like components,
    e.g., <code>&lt;Product&gt;</code>. A component is defined
    by JavaScript code that contains data, HTML, CSS, and functions
    for displaying and updating that component as the data changes.

  <div>
    JavaScript has changed a great deal in the past five years.
    Underneath it's the same prototype-based language with full
    support for functional programming, but
    EcmaScript 2015 and later have added a large number of important extensions,
    many of which React depends on.
  </div>

  <div>
    The most critical of these extensions, for React developers, are
    <ul>
      <li>Import and export</li>
      <li>Classes</li>
      <li>Arrow functions</li>
      <li>Destructuring assignment</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

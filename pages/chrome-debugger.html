    Google Chrome and other browsers have built-in debugging tools. These
    tools can inspect the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on a web page, and
    provide debugging support such as breakpoints and stack inspection.

    React code is modified greatly before being delivered to a browser.
    Components are replaced with real HTML elements, and JavaScript code
    is transpiled, merged, and often compacted, into a "bundle" of code.
    Fortunately, React generates a "source map" that Chrome uses, so that
    you can interact with your original code, rather than the compiled mess
    that is generated. By adding the React extension to Chrome, you can
    also see your React component objects.

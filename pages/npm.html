    NPM is the node package manager. Modern JavaScript applications
    use many libraries, most of whih depend in turn on other libraries,
    and so on. It's not uncommon for even a small application to need
    thousands or tens of thousands of libaries.

    NPM is a command line program. When the command
    <strong>npm install</strong> is run inside a project folder, 
    it looks for a <strong>package.json</strong> file. That files
    specifies what libraries the project depends on. It goes to 
    package registries on line to download those libraries. As it does so,
    it finds other <strong>package.json</strong> files, and
    downloads what they list.

  <div>
    The files are downloaded into the project subdirectory 
    <strong>node_modules</strong>.

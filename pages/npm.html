  NPM is the node package manager. Modern JavaScript applications
  use many libraries, most of whih depend in turn on other libraries,
  and so on. It's not uncommon for even a small application to need
  thousands or tens of thousands of libaries.

  NPM is a command line program. When the command
  <strong>npm install</strong> is run inside a project folder, 
  it looks for a <strong>package.json</strong> file. That files
  specifies what libraries the project depends on. It goes to 
  package registries on line to download those libraries. As it does so,
  it finds other <strong>package.json</strong> files, and
  downloads what they list.

<div>
  The files are downloaded into the project subdirectory 
  <strong>node_modules</strong>. This directory of nested directory
  gets large fast -- tens of thousands of files is common.

  documentation. Yarn had major advantages two years ago, now
  npm is comparable. Teams should
  pick one or the other. Use
